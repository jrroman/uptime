# Uptime

just add site names, urls, and email to sites.csv as follows:

```
site_name sub.domain.tld email
```

this file is parsed just on the space so please
only use spaces to separate the site name from the URL
email is used to send in case there is a bad status code on the site

### Installation

Just run the `install.sh` within `bin/`

```
./bin/install.sh
```
